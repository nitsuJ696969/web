						<strong>Kashi Vishwanath Temple</strong>
						<img src="img/vns-7.jpg" width="700" height="400" style="border: 5px solid #555">
						<p>Situated on the western bank of holy river Ganga in Varanasi, Kashi Vishwanath Temple is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas or temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. The main deity of Kashi Vishwanath Temple is Lord Shiva, also known as Vishwanatha or Vishweshwarar meaning 'the ruler of the universe'. The city of Varanasi, the cultural capital of India, is thus known as the city of Lord Shiva. The temple has 800 kg of gold plating on its tower.</p>
						<p>Camera, mobile phones, electronic devices are not allowed inside and must be deposited in lockers outside. Foreigners can enter from Gate number 2 where they can walk past the Indians waiting for their turn. There is also a well present within the temple complex called Jnana Vapi or wisdom well where only Hindus are allowed to enter.</p>
						<p>In the olden times, on special festivals such as Shivaratri, the king of Kashi (Kashi Naresh) visited the temple for worship during which nobody else is allowed to enter the temple premises. Devotees were allowed after the king had concluded his prayers. The importance of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple also stems from the fact that it finds mentions in several holy scriptures of the Hindus. On the outside, the temple is adorned with intricate carvings that impart a divine quality to the facade.  Other than that, the temple also houses several other small temples such as Kaalbhairav, Vishnu, Virupaksh Gauri, Vinayaka and Avimukteshwara.</p>

						<img src="img/vns-5.jpg" width="700" height="400" style="border: 5px solid #555">
						<p>The New Vishwanath Temple is every pious man's go-to destination to feel overwhelmed by the presence and power of the great Lord Shiva. Not only is it located in the heart of the cultural capital of India - Varanasi, but its divinity is multiplied by the holy river Ganga that flows by its side. Banaras Hindu University is hence home to one of the biggest tourist attractions in the city of Varanasi, the grand New Vishwanath Temple. Visiting this temple gives the worshipper the space to put himself in the hands of God, at his disposition, and listen to the voice in his heart.</p>
						<p>The peace and calm of the temple help you forget the distractions of daily life. The positive aura in the air compels one to surrender himself in the gentle caress of the Almighty. The very famous Jyotirlinga of Shiva, Vishweshwara, is believed to have immense and unending power. A single glance of this Jyotirlinga has the ability to cleanse our soul and set us on the true path of knowledge and devotion.</p>
						<p>Although primarily a Lord Shiva temple, this beautiful temple consists of nine other temples within one and invites people of every faith to bask in its grandeur; using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism. The New Vishwanath Temple incorporates every element of the Hindu cosmos- the good, the evil and the human; thus implying the major role that Dharma, Kama, Artha, Moksa and Karma play in our life.</p>
